      "Okay, so the user asked for a complex Python code for the FCFS algorithm. Hmm, FCFS is First Come First Served, a basic scheduling algorithm. But they want it complex, so I need to think about what makes it complex.\n",
      "\n",
      " the basics. Let's see, the basic FCFS just processes jobs in the order they arrive. But to make it complex, perhaps include different job types, priorities, or resource allocation. Oh, and maybe simulate preemption or something like that.\n",
      "\n",
      " might be looking for something that's not just a simple simulation. Maybe they want to handle multiple resources or track various metrics. I should consider including things like job arrival times, burst times, and then calculate waiting times and turn-around times.\n",
      "\n",
      " would make it more complex and visually appealing. Using matplotlib to plot the Gantt chart could be a good idea. That way, the user can see the scheduling visually.\n",

      " the code with classes to make it object-oriented. Maybe a Job class to represent each job with attributes like ID, arrival time, burst time, priority, and resource requirements. Then a Scheduler class to handle the scheduling logic.\n",
      "\n",
      "'ll need methods to add jobs, sort them based on arrival time, and then process them in order. Calculating waiting times and turn-around times is essential for performance metrics. Also, tracking resource usage can add another layer of complexity.\n",

      "'ll collect the start and end times of each job and then plot them using matplotlib. This will give a clear visual representation of how the CPU is being utilized over time.\n",
