      "Creating a code for the \"toughest\" algorithm is a bit subjective, as the difficulty of an algorithm can vary based on the context, the problem it solves, and the constraints involved. However, I can provide you with an example of a complex algorithm that is often considered challenging: the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using a **Genetic Algorithm**. The TSP is a classic optimization problem that is NP-hard, meaning that as the number of cities increases, the time required to find an exact solution grows exponentially.\n",
